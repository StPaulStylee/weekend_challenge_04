# Noted
A To Do Application
## Created By: Jeffrey Miller
###About Noted
Noted is a simple To Do list application. It allows the user to add tasks that
need to be completed and subsequently remove them when the task is complete.
###Things to Finish
- Move completed tasks to the bottom of the page.
###Bugs that Need Fixing
- There is a weird 500 error when an item is deleted. What is bizarre is that
it is a error on a PUT request. The delete still functions.
