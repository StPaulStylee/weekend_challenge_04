# Noted
A To Do Application
## Created By: Jeffrey Miller
###About Noted
Noted is a simple To Do list application. It allows the user to add tasks that
need to be completed and subsequently remove them when the task is complete.
###Things to Finish
- Stylying needed to be applied to entire app.
- Move completed tasks to the bottom of the page.
###Bugs that Need Fixing
- An empty task field is allowed to be sent to the server and entered into the
database. That needs to be fixed.
- If user refreshes page after completing a task, the styling the indicates
the completion goes back to default.
- The $toggleClass function used to apply completing styling is set up in such
a way that it applies to every single list-item in the section.
